Welcome to the `jen` skeleton site.

This is a great starting point for your own site.
Start with the links at the bottom if you want to
read about what `jen` does and how it works.

But don't be afraid of just diving in. Edit
`_layouts/default.jade` to change the overall containing
markup. Look in `_pages` and `_posts` for...
pages and posts. `_scripts` and `_styles` are also
probably high on the list.

Crash course in running this thing:

    cd path/to/skeleton
    jen
    # edit files, etc, site updates automatically
    # when you're done/happy...
    ^C
    jen --build
    # edit config.coffee and write deploy command
    jen --deploy
